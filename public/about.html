<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Chanté Miles, a 21-year-old creative enthusiast with a passion for all things artistic. My journey began with a formal education in film and television at Open Window, where I honed my skills in visual storytelling. After that, I embarked on a year-long adventure into the world of tattoo artistry, adding another layer to my creative repertoire.</p>

<p>Creativity flows through every aspect of my life. Whether it's crafting compelling narratives, designing intricate tattoos, or capturing moments through photography, I thrive on bringing ideas to life. I’ve had the privilege of working on numerous marketing and social media projects, which have equipped me with a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of digital engagement.</p>
  
<p> In collaboration with my father, I run a small photography business. This venture has not only strengthened our bond but also allowed me to explore the beauty of capturing moments that matter.</p>
  
<p>Recently, I decided to take on a new challenge: web development. Frustrated with the difficulty of conveying my vision to web developers, I enrolled in a course to gain the skills needed to build my own websites. Now, I'm excited to combine my creative talents with technical expertise to create unique and personal online experiences.</p>
  
<p>Thank you for visiting my website. I look forward to connecting with you and sharing more of my creative journey.</p>
